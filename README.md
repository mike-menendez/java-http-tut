# What is this?
This is a repo to demonstrate building a HTTP Client and HTTP Server in Java 11 without using any external libs.

# Repo Structure
The structure isn't very typical as I was trying to jam everything in here to only have one repo to manage.

## Python Directory
The python directory contains an HTTP server and a script that HTTP requests.

The server can handle url parameters on the base url as well as download of a dummyfile.

The client script demonstrates making the appropriate requests. 

Both should be of use when making the Java Client and Server to validate while building both out.
